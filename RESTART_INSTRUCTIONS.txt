================================================================================
                    🚨 YOU MUST RESTART THE SERVER NOW! 🚨
================================================================================

The error you're seeing:
  "Cannot GET /api/admin/generated-images"

Means: The endpoint doesn't exist on your RUNNING server.

Why? Your server started BEFORE this endpoint was added to the code.

================================================================================
                              HOW TO FIX:
================================================================================

1. Go to the terminal where your Node.js server is running
   (The terminal that shows "Server running on port 3000")

2. Press: Ctrl+C
   (This stops the server)

3. Type: node index.js
   (This starts the server with NEW code)

4. You should see:
   ✅ Server running on port 3000
   ✅ Connected to Supabase

5. Go to browser and login again at: http://localhost:3000/admin

6. Then navigate to: /admin/generated-images

7. Should work now! ✅

================================================================================
                          VERIFICATION:
================================================================================

After restarting, open browser console (F12) and you should see:

🔄 Fetching generated images...
📥 Response status: 200
📥 Response content-type: application/json; charset=utf-8
✅ Loaded X images

Instead of:

❌ Response status: 404
❌ Cannot GET /api/admin/generated-images

================================================================================

THE ENDPOINT EXISTS IN YOUR CODE (line 5754 of index.js)
BUT YOUR RUNNING SERVER DOESN'T KNOW ABOUT IT YET!

RESTART = LOAD NEW CODE INTO SERVER PROCESS

================================================================================
